      Hey lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
      Nigga touch my gang we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
      <i>ICE</i> on my neck cost me ten times three
      Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee

      I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
      When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
      And I keep like <i>ten phones</i>, damn I'm really never home</a>

He has hella fans so complex that he needs to memorize his records more fully if he is to push his sick bars to its logical hype level and not merely become bogged down part way there by reaching his smacked limit. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he syph's all day, forgetting the responsibilities he has as a trap god."
