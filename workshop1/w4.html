      "The <a href = "https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html">Analytical
      Engine</a> has no pretensions whatever to <i>originate</i>
      anything. It can do whatever we <i>know how to order it</i> to
      perform. It can <i>follow</i> analysis; but it has no power of
      <i>anticipating</i> any analytical relations or truths. Its province is
      to assist us to making <i>available</i> what we are already acquainted
      with." &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>

      "A man's spirit should be elevated if he can review his shady past. He has hella fans so complex that he needs to memorize his records more fully if he is to push his sick bars to its logical hype level and not merely become bogged down part way there by reaching his smacked limit. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he syph's all day, forgetting the responsibilities he has as a trap god."
